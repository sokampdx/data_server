### Project Layout

All source code should be located in the `src/main/java` folder.
If you wish to write any tests (not a requirement) they should be
located in the `src/test/java` folder.

### Assumptions

- Report of Status only on completed connections
- Terminate with keyword "terminate" will stop all incoming connection accept but allow currently running threads to completed.
